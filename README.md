realtalk. (RESTful API)
=====
real talk in real time.

This is the repositiory for the realtalk. backend. For the Angular front-end,
see [realtalk-front](https://github.com/whenther/realtalk-front).  


real immediate
--------------
In a normal chat app, you compose a message, then send it -
basically really fast letter writing. realtalk. is different. It sends 
each character you type, as you type it. It all happens in real time, 
letting you talk over each other and finish each other's sentences, -
just like when you're actually talking to someone.  

True, it isn't always the most efficient. But it's real conversation, 
and that's a rare thing for text.

real temporary
--------------
Where we're going, we don't need chat logs. You've got a box showing the last 50
characters you typed, and another showing the last 50 characters your friend 
typed. The server's got nothing. That's it.

In real time, a conversation moves pretty quickly. So if you want to keep up,
you've got to be paying attention. Sometimes, that's not practical. But when you
really want to talk to someone, needing to keep the other browser tabs closed 
is kind of nice.

real mobile
-----------
realtalk. isn't just for desktop. This webapp is built mobile-first and works 
great on your smartphone, you you can grab the Android app for (planned) 
notifications. Since you're typing in real-time, autocorrect is disabled, 
so you've got nobody to blame but Freud when you "mistype" something.


For a complete description, check out the app online or in the Google Play store.
